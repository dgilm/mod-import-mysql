## Module:      MySQLImport
## Loaded by:   Arbiter
# Hosts, Services, Contacts and Dependencies configuration can be pulled from a
# MySQL database.
# All configuration read from the DB will be added to those read from the
# standard flat files. -- Be careful of duplicated names!
# You can easily use an existing database, you just have to define the queries
# to suit your database.
# It can be a useful module to use for HA too! :)
